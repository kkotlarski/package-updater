# package-updater

Welcome to package.json updater.
In order to run the script create your `.env` file in the root directory from `.env-default` and provide the missing values. BB stands for BitBucket and we use user name (withoug `@domain.com`) and the App password (https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/)
The script will apply any data from `src/newData.json` so please remember to update it before running.
When you are ready just run `npm start` and wait for the result.
Enjoy!
